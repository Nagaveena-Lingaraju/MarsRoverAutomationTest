# MarsRoverAutomationTest
Test cases for Mars rover Problem
I have written simple test cases Considering the sample solution provided for the problem in attached document and i have implemented all my tests using JUnit.
As source program is very simple, I tested only mentioned test cases in attached document. But if we add more features to source program we can add many BDD scenarios for testing as well. Some sample scenarios are covered in BDD sample test document.
I would go with approach of building a automation framework using page object module design pattern
